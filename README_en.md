### Preface and Roadmap
Summarizing the experience from CS61A, I am setting up a new learning strategy.
#### 1. Input
Efficiency is crucial.
I'll alternate between watching videos and reading texts while learning, and also practice important concepts mentioned by myself. But don't spend too much time on this.
#### 2. Output
After reviewing the Calendar and Textbook, I found that there are hardly any exercise suggestions after the lectures.
Therefore, I'll follow the plan but continue inputting while writing lab/hw/proj, without getting stuck.
#### 3. Efficiency
The course plan is 15 weeks, which is too long. I should aim to finish in around 8 weeks.
Therefore, I need to be concise and not get stuck. Grasp the main idea.
To study efficiently, it's best to limit myself to finish a task within a certain time frame, don't get caught up in perfectionism, grasp the main idea. Because some theoretical details will be quickly forgotten, while the most applied ones will be remembered.
